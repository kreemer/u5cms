DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THE FOLDER r AND ITS SUBFOLDERS

The content in the folder r and its subfolders is written by the server.
Therefore the folder r, its files, its subdirectories and there files must be writable by the server.

If you want to edit the htmltemplate and/or css files, do this in the u5CMS backend: 
Section s (special functions) in the PIDVESA navigation, there click the button 'code (html template & css)'.
