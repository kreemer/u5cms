When ever possible, do not downsize the images before uploading them here in the std Ímages-section, the system will downsize them automatically.\n\nHowever, if automatic downsizing fails (because of memory overflow), you either have to augment the memory limit of your hosting (cf. admin backend of your provider or php.ini) or do downsize the images manually before uploading them.\n\nIf you have to do manual downsizing, make the long edge 2000px long and choose JPG-quality 70%.\n\nFurther: Images uploaded here must be JPG with RGB colors (not CMYK). Other image file types (e. g. PNG, SVG, GIF) have to be uploaded in the free Images-section of PIDVESA´s I-section!\n\nInformation about automatic downsizing: It works according to the parameters $limitjpgsizetobytes, $resizedlongedgepx, and $resamplingquality in your u5CMS installation´s config.php (example config.php cf. https://yuba.ch/cp).
