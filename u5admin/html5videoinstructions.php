AUDIO INFOS\nFor audio, upload mp3-files here. Enabling autoplay cf. video infos below.\n\nVIDEO INFOS\nVideos uploaded here are streamed from your web-server. Consider uploading the videos on YouTube. You may embed YouTube Videos in PIDVESA´s V-section´s youtube-section.\n\nFile format:\nHowever, if you want to stream the videos from your web-server, i. e. uploading video files here, upload H.264-encoded mp4-files.\n\nAutoplay:\nIf the first character of the u5CMS-video-object-name is an exclamation mark (!), autoplay is enabled. However, autoplay is overruled by some browsers always or heuristically.\n\nPoster (Thumbnail):\nTo upload a poster, expand the video-object-list in PIDVESA´s V-section by activating the right P-radio button (cf. 3×2 PSF radio-buttons below the title «Video&amp;Audio» there); then click the appearing POSTER(thumbnail)-link(s).\n\nComplementary file types:\nIf you want to add a complementary ogv-file, create an additional u5CMS-video-object with the same name but an additional trailing letter ´o´ and upload the ogv there (same pattern for additional ogg-audio-files).\n\nAdobe Flash representation:\nIt is really not recommended, but you may activate Adobe Flash representation of your video if the last character of your video´s u5CMS-video-object-name is an exclamation mark (that´s also true for audio).
