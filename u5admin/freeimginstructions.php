Here, in the free Image-section of PIDVESA´s I-section, you may upload any image file type renderable by web browsers.\n\nCompared to the std Image-section, here no automatic downsizing does happen, and on your web page, ´free´ images will be rendered with no dedicated zooming utility.\n\n In the upper right corner of the metadata window of the u5CMS-object at hand (cf. ´M´ link on the upload page at hand), you may enter the dimensons how the image shall be rendered. If you do not enter any values there, the image will be rendered in its pysical dimensions. It is recommended that you enter values there and prepare the image with physical dimensions twice as large.
